 * every exported declaration, every public member of an exported class, and
 * every substantial private function needs JSDoc that contributes information
 * beyond its identifier. The analyzer has no ignore list and treats unknown
 * declaration forms as violations, so a new syntax form fails closed.
 *
 * The gate logic is wrapped in {@link runGate} and only invoked when the script
 * is executed directly (not when imported by a test for coverage tracking),
 * mirroring the main-invocation guard `scripts/coverage-gate.ts` already uses.
